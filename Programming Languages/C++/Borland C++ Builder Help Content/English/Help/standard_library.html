<h1 Align="Center">C++ I/O library (experimental)</h1>
</Center>    

<P>
This is an <em>experimental</em> snapshot of SGI's standard C++
library.  You should <A Href="#snapshot">download</A> it if you are 
interested in contributing to an ongoing development effort, but not
(yet) if you are looking for a library implementation that is
guaranteed to work &quot;out of the box&quot;.

<P>
This snapshot includes the entire standard C++ library: STL,
iostream/locale, and numerics (<tt>valarray</tt> and
<tt>complex</tt>).  It does not include a standard C library
implementation; it is intended to interoperate with an existing C
library.

<P>
Please note that some aspects of an I/O library are inherently
platform-specific.  (See below for more details.)  This library has
been tested on IRIX 6.x using the SGI MIPSpro 7.3 compiler, and on
Linux, using glibc 2.0 and the egcs 1.1.2 compilers.  It passes simple
tests on Microsoft Windows NT using the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
compiler (with Service Pack 3).  Compiling it on other platforms will
almost certainly require at least some work.  Porting to another
version of Unix, using a relatively recent C++ compiler, should not be
difficult.

<P>
We welcome suggestions, patches, and bug fixes.  Please send 
comments to <A Href="mailto:stl@sgi.com">stl@sgi.com</A>.

<h2>Some notes on the structure of the I/O library</h2>

<ul>
<li>
    It shares some files, such as char_traits.h, with our STL.  These
    snapshots include the full STL distribution as well as the
    iostreams implementation, since it's hard to draw a line between
    these two parts of the standard C++ library.
    
<P><li>
    Certain parts of the STL depend on the I/O library, and they
    behave differently depending on whether they use &quot;classic&quot;
    AT&amp;T cfront iostreams or a standard-conforming I/O
    implementation with templatized iostreams.  To use the new iostreams
    library you must tell the compiler where to find the headers,
    add the I/O library to the link line, and tell the STL that it should
    use standard-conforming iostreams.  A compilation line may look something
    like this:
    <pre>
    g++  -I.  -D__STL_USE_NEW_IOSTREAMS -g hello.cxx libCio.a
    </pre>
    Alternatively, you can edit the <tt>stl_config.h</tt> header so
    that the macro <tt>__STL_USE_NEW_IOSTREAMS</tt> gets defined
    automatically.
<P><li>
    Locales are a tricky point.  It is impossible to layer C++ locales
    on top of the C library locales.  The problem is that the standard
    C library only has one active locale at a time, as determined by
    the global <tt>setlocale</tt> function.  In C++, though, locales
    are objects, and there can be any number of active locales at the
    same time.  In a single-threaded world it would be possible
    (although horribly inefficient) to implement this with
    <tt>setlocale</tt>, but there's no safe way to do that in a
    multithreaded environment.

    <P>
    This iostream/locale library is intended to coexist with a
    preexisting C library.  It assumes that for any C library
    implementation there is some way---just not a portable way---to
    get at the underlying data files so that we can have multiple
    active locales.  We defined an interface, found in in
    <tt>c_locale.h</tt>, for this functionality.  Our C++ I/O library
    requires some implementation for the <tt>c_locale.h</tt>
    interface.  We believe that implementing the <tt>c_locale.h</tt>
    interface is the major work involved in porting the I/O library to
    a new platform.

    <P>
    We have implemented the c_locale interface for the IRIX C library
    (it is not included here because it includes code that, for legal
    reasons, SGI can't release as open source), and for the GNU glibc
    2.x library.
    
    <P>
    Additionally, we provide a stub implementation of the c_locale
    interface.  This interface is used only for named locales that the
    OS knows about, such as (in IRIX) &quot;de&quot;,
    &quot;es_MX&quot;, and &quot;fr_BE&quot;.  It isn't used for
    user-defined locales, or for the classic locale.  So the stub
    implementation takes any string, and returns a failure indication
    when the user attempts to create a named locale.  That's perfectly
    conforming, according to the C++ standard, and it's even useful.
    (At least for people who don't have a pressing need for
    internationalization.)  This can serve as a stopgap for platforms 
    where we don't yet have a real c_locale implementation.

<P><li>
    There are a couple of smaller places where we have
    system-dependent code.  One, of course, is in
    <tt>basic_filebuf</tt> (see especially <tt>fstream.cxx</tt>),
    which makes system calls for reading and writing.  (On Unix, it
    uses such system calls as <tt>open</tt>, <tt>close</tt>,
    <tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt>, <tt>fcntl</tt>, <tt>lseek</tt>,
    <tt>mmap</tt>, and <tt>munmap</tt>.)

    <p>
    We have tried to abstract out as much system-dependent stuff as
    possible into the <tt>_Filebuf_base</tt> class.  At present it
    supports IRIX and Linux; porting to other versions of Unix should
    be easy.  There is also some incomplete support for NT; issues
    there include the '\n' &lt;-&gt; CRLF translation in text mode,
    and the use of native Win32 system calls, especially for memory 
    mapped I/O.

<P><li>
    Another place where we've got system dependent code is syncing
    with stdio.  The C++ standard requires that there be a mode in
    which iostreams and stdio are synchronized (the C++ standard is
    imprecise about just what synchronization means, but, after
    talking to the people who wrote that part of the standard, it's
    clear that it means a very close coupling), and it requires that
    synchronized mode be the default.  We could have satisfied this
    requirement by implementing things in terms of <tt>putc</tt> and
    <tt>getc</tt>, but that would have been horribly inefficient.
    Instead we did something uglier, but more efficient: we directly
    manipulate the pointers inside a <tt>FILE</tt> object.  We've
    encapsulated knowledge of struct <tt>FILE</tt> into the header
    <tt>&lt;stl_stdio_file.h&gt;</tt>, which defines a few inline functions
    for this manipulation.  Again, this header has to be modified for
    every OS that we target.  This has not proven to be a serious problem
    in practice, since most stdio implementations appear to be very 
    similar to each other.
<P>
    (An aside: the C++ standard does not say what type of streambuf is
    used by the standard streams, <tt>cin</tt>, <tt>cout</tt>,
    <tt>cerr</tt>, etc.  Our choice: the wide streams, and in
    unsynchronized mode the narrow streams as well, use
    <tt>basic_filebuf</tt>.  In synchronized mode the narrow streams
    instead use <tt>SGI::stdio_istreambuf</tt> or
    <tt>SGI::stdio_ostreambuf</tt>.  Those classes are defined in the
    header <tt>&lt;stdio_streambuf&gt;</tt>, and, of course, they are extensions.)

<P><li>
    Initialization of iostreams is tricky.  The standard specifies how
    it's supposed to work in some detail, and it doesn't seem to be
    possible to do it portably.  Our solution, which is admittedly
    a ghastly hack, is in <tt>iostream.cxx</tt>.  It's nonportable, but
    it will work on many platforms.  On some platforms there are better
    ways of doing this.
</ul>


<h2>Areas that need more work</h2>

<ul>
<li> Portability to other platforms
  <ul>
  <li> Workarounds for compilers that don't support the full C++ language
  <li> Writing a low-level locale implementation for other C libraries.
  <li> Use native file I/O system calls for non-Unix operating systems.
  <li> Testing on other configurations
  </ul>
<li> The <tt>basic_fstream</tt> class sometimes uses memory-mapped I/O 
     for file input.  It should also use memory-mapped I/O for output 
     when possible.
<li> Testing of nontrivial code conversions from wide to narrow characters,
     especially with variable-width and state-dependent encodings, has
     been sporadic; it's likely that there are still bugs in this area.
     Most of the relevant code is in <tt>&lt;fstream&gt;</tt>.
<li> The numeric input facets handle <tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt>
     naively.  They should look directly at the buffer inside the
     streambuf, rather than using <tt>sgetc</tt>, <tt>sbumpc</tt>,
     and <tt>snextc</tt> to get one character at a time.  (See the 
     header <tt>&lt;istream&gt;</tt> for an example of how this can be done.)
     The same optimization applies to the time and monetary facets, but 
     they're less important.
<li> There has been some performance tuning for better execution speed,
     but there has been very little performance tuning for code size
     or compilation speed.
</ul>

Many small bug fixes and compatibility patches.  Change to the
low-level locale API to improve handling of locale "", which 
indicates that we are to use a locale that corresponds to the user's
preference.  (The major changes are in c_locale.h and locale.cxx.)
This change is probably a performance improvement in the common case.

so that they conform to the resolution to library issue 136

remove the extension of a second template parameter.  The extension
does not appear to be standard-conforming (see library issue 94),
